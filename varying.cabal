-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            FRP through value streams and monadic splines.

-- A longer description of the package.
description:         Varying is a FRP library aimed at providing a
                     simple way to describe values that change over a domain.
                     It allows monadic, applicative and arrow notation and has
                     convenience functions for tweening.
